//! Anonymous Credit Tokens (ACT).
//!
//! ACT is a keyed-verification anonymous credential whose hidden state is a
//! *balance* of credits. A Moderator issues a [`Credential`] with an initial
//! balance; the Client later *spends* a public amount `s`, proving in zero
//! knowledge that the Credential covers it and has not been spent before, and
//! receives a *refund*: a fresh Credential for the remainder plus a
//! Moderator-chosen return amount `t`. The Moderator never learns the balance
//! and cannot link a spend to the issuance or refund that produced the
//! Credential, nor two spends to each other.
//!
//! This crate implements
//! [draft-authors-mole-act](https://moderation-of-unlinkable-endorsements.github.io/internet-drafts/draft-authors-mole-act.html)
//! for the `P256-SHA256` ciphersuite. The zero-knowledge proofs are compact
//! NARG strings of `draft-irtf-cfrg-sigma-protocols-03`, produced by
//! statement-specific provers that emit the same bytes as the generic
//! construction while sharing work across equations.
//!
//! # Flow
//!
//! ```
//! use act::{Params, SecretKey};
//!
//! // Both parties agree on the balance width `L` and a credential context.
//! let params: Params = Params::new(8)?;
//! let ctx_cred = b"epoch-42";
//!
//! // The Moderator holds the key pair and publishes the public key.
//! let secret_key = SecretKey::generate()?;
//! let public_key = secret_key.public_key();
//!
//! // Issuance: the Client requests, the Moderator chooses the balance.
//! let (state, request) = act::issue_request(&params)?;
//! let response = act::issue_response(&params, &secret_key, ctx_cred, 100, &request)?;
//! let credential = act::finalize_issue(&params, &public_key, ctx_cred, state, &response)?;
//! assert_eq!(credential.balance(), 100);
//!
//! // Spending: spend 30 credits under the challenge digest `ctx_spend`,
//! // with no top-up allowance; the Moderator returns 5 credits.
//! let ctx_spend = b"challenge-digest";
//! let (state, spend) = act::prove_spend(&params, credential, ctx_cred, 30, 0, ctx_spend)?;
//! let verified = act::verify_spend(&params, &secret_key, ctx_cred, ctx_spend, &spend)?;
//! // ... the Moderator grants `verified.allowance()` and atomically records
//! // `verified.nullifier()` together with the refund ...
//! let refund = act::issue_refund(verified, 5)?;
//! let credential = act::finalize_refund(&params, &public_key, ctx_cred, state, &refund)?;
//! assert_eq!(credential.balance(), 75);
//! # Ok::<(), act::Error>(())
//! ```
//!
//! Every message and the Credential have a fixed wire encoding, exposed as
//! `to_bytes` and `from_bytes` on each type.
//!
//! # Backends
//!
//! Group and hash operations come from a [`Backend`], selected with Cargo
//! features: `rustcrypto` (default, pure Rust) or `boringssl` (BoringSSL
//! through `bssl-sys`, as used by Chromium). When both are enabled,
//! `boringssl` is the [`DefaultBackend`]; every type takes the backend as a
//! type parameter that defaults to it.
//!
//! # Security notes
//!
//! * `prove_spend` consumes the Credential and `finalize_issue` and
//!   `finalize_refund` consume their state, so a value cannot be used twice
//!   within a process. Persisted copies are the wallet's responsibility.
//! * [`verify_spend`] returns a [`VerifiedSpend`] that is bound to the exact
//!   message, key, configuration, and contexts it checked. The Moderator must
//!   reject a repeated nullifier and record it atomically with the refund.
//! * Operations on the Client's balance and blinding factors, and on the
//!   Moderator's signing key, are constant time with respect to those values.
//!   The exception is point addition in the BoringSSL backend, which branches
//!   when its operands are equal or negatives of each other; when a secret
//!   operand is random and independent of the other, the branch is taken
//!   with negligible probability.
//! * Secrets are zeroized on drop.
