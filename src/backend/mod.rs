//! Group and hash primitives behind the protocol.
//!
//! The protocol is written against the [`Backend`] trait, which supplies the
//! P-256 scalar field and group, SHA-256, hash-to-curve, and the operating
//! system's random number generator. Two implementations are provided:
//!
//! * `rustcrypto::RustCrypto` (feature `rustcrypto`): the `p256`, `sha2`,
//!   and `getrandom` crates.
//! * `boringssl::BoringSsl` (feature `boringssl`): BoringSSL through the
//!   `bssl-sys` bindings, as Chromium builds it. BoringSSL does not export
//!   SHAKE128, so that one primitive comes from the `shake` crate for now
//!   (the `shake` module).
//!
//! Both encode scalars as 32-byte big-endian integers below the group order
//! and points as 33-byte compressed SEC1 strings, and neither accepts an
//! encoding of the identity element.
